Hybrid AI Travel Assistant 
--------------------------------------------------
Overview

This project implements a Hybrid Knowledge AI System that generates contextual, multi-day travel itineraries for Vietnam using a combination of graph reasoning (Neo4j), semantic search (Pinecone), and language generation (Hugging Face models).

The assistant retrieves relevant travel nodes, enriches them with graph relations, and composes structured natural language responses ‚Äî demonstrating a full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

üß© Core Components
Module	Description:

1.Neo4j (Docker)	Graph database for storing and querying relationships between cities and destinations.

2.Pinecone	Vector database for semantic text search using dense embeddings.

3.SentenceTransformer	Local embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for cost-free vector generation.

4.Hugging Face Models	Language models (SmolLM3-3B, Zephyr-7B) for itinerary generation.

5.FastAPI / Streamlit	Interfaces for REST and interactive chat applications.
