Improvements 

 
1.Embedding Optimization
Replaced remote OpenAI embedding calls with local SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for offline, cost-free, and faster embedding generation.
Integrated async threading (asyncio.to_thread) to ensure non-blocking performance during vector encoding.

_______________________________
2.System Reliability
Fixed deprecated Pinecone SDK v2 calls and verified index health checks with describe_index_stats().
Added robust error handling for all external API calls (Pinecone, Neo4j, Hugging Face).
Implemented query caching (query_cache.pkl) to improve response time and reduce redundant vector searches.

3.Enhanced Reasoning & Prompt Engineering
Designed a structured, domain-aware prompt optimized for travel planning.
Added markdown-based, human-readable itinerary formatting with day-wise structure and cultural insights.
Integrated two Hugging Face models (SmolLM3-3B and Arch-Router-1.5B) with fallback for resilience.
Cleaned LLM reflections using regex to remove <think> traces for production-quality output.
__________________________

4.Scalability & Extendibility
Adopted async architecture for Pinecone + Neo4j queries to scale to larger datasets.
Modular design allows easy swapping of vector DBs, LLMs, or embedding models.
Ready for multi-region scaling and caching extensions (Redis or Faiss).

Result:
Achieved a fully functional, optimized, and scalable Hybrid Knowledge AI System â€” combining vector retrieval, graph reasoning, and generative LLM intelligence for contextual, high-quality travel itineraries.
